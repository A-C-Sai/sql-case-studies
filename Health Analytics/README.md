# Health Analytics


# Background Information and Task

We’ve just received an urgent request from the General Manager of Analytics at Health Co. requesting our assistance with their analysis.

The Health Co. analytics team have shared with us their SQL script - they unfortunately ran into a few bugs that they couldn’t fix!

We’ve been asked to quickly debug their SQL script and use the resulting query outputs to answer a few questions that the GM has requested for a board meeting about their active users.
