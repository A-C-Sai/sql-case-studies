# Background Information and Task

Danny has opened a restaurant recently and needs help to keep it afloat. During the few months of their operation, the<br>restaurant has captured some basic data but they have no idea on how to use the data to drive their business.

Given the data they have collected, Danny wants us to draw few insights about his customers:
 - visiting patterns
 - money spent
 - favourite menu items
